Project 3a, an assignment for ENGR 103 at Oregon State University. 

Write a program that asks the user how many integers they would like to enter. 
You can assume that this initial input will be an integer >= 1. 
The program will then prompt the user to enter that many integers. 
After all the numbers have been entered, the program should display the largest and smallest of those numbers 
(no, you cannot use lists, or any other material we haven't covered). 
Your code should work correctly no matter what integers the user enters.
